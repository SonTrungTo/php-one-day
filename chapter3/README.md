## Basic PHP tasks
- displaying outputs to users
- duplicating codes across multiple pages
- redirecting users

No `?>` if there's only PHP codes to prevent unwanted whitespace issue at EOF => Warning `Headers already sent" warning issue when modifying response headers.

### Duplicating codes
- `include` vs `require`: the latter stops the script and throws error.
- `include_once`
- `require_once`

### Redirect Users
- `<meta>` tag is used in HTML, but PHP built-in `header()` does the trick.
- Functions like these must be placed before ANY outputs generated by scripted to the browser => Warning: `Headers already sent`.
